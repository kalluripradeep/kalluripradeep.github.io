## 🎤 Upcoming Engagements

### Oxford Microsoft Data Platform Group
**Date:** January 21, 2026  
**Format:** Online Presentation (1.5 hours with Q&A)  
**Location:** Virtual  
**Status:** ✅ **CONFIRMED**  
**Event Link:** [Register on Meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/oxfordmicrosoft/events/305535226/)

**Title:** From Raw to Refined: Building Production Data Pipelines That Scale

**Abstract:**  
Architecture patterns and practical lessons from building scalable data pipelines in production. Covers the journey from raw data ingestion through transformation to analytics-ready datasets, with Azure-based demonstrations.

**Topics:**
- Data pipeline architecture (Bronze → Silver → Gold pattern)
- Real-time ingestion with Azure Data Factory and Databricks
- Transformation best practices with PySpark
- Data modeling in Azure Synapse Analytics
- Orchestration and monitoring strategies

**Technologies:** Azure Data Factory, Azure Databricks, Azure Synapse Analytics, Azure Data Lake Storage, PySpark

**Audience:** Data engineers, analytics engineers, and data platform architects

## 🎯 Speaking Topics

### Production Data Pipeline Mistakes
**Duration:** 30-60 minutes

Real production incidents from financial services data engineering. Each story includes the problem, debugging process, root cause, and lessons learned.

**Key Stories:**
- Silent data loss (10% of transactions)
- Weekend-only failures
- Currency format bugs ($100 → 10,000)
- Schema changes creating duplicates
- Retry logic processing same day 47 times

**Audience:** Data engineers, software engineers working with data

---

### Building Scalable Data Pipelines
**Duration:** 45-60 minutes

Architecture patterns for production data platforms, from ingestion to analytics. Includes real-world examples from processing millions of transactions daily.

**Topics:**
- Layered architecture (Raw → Curated → Business)
- Streaming vs batch processing
- Data quality frameworks
- Orchestration patterns
- Monitoring and observability

**Audience:** Data engineers, data architects, platform engineers

---

## 💡 Speaking Philosophy

**Real experiences over theory** - Every talk is based on actual production work

**Practical and actionable** - Attendees leave with patterns they can apply immediately

**Honest about failures** - Sharing what went wrong and how we fixed it

**Interactive and engaging** - Encouraging questions and discussion throughout

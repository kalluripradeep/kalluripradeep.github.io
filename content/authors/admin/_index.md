I'm a Data Engineer with hands-on experience designing, developing, and deploying scalable data pipelines for advanced analytics and AI-driven solutions. Currently working at NatWest Bank on cloud data platform modernization.

I specialize in building production-grade ELT workflows using Python, PySpark, and Airflow across AWS, Azure, and GCP. Passionate about leveraging data engineering to accelerate AI adoption and drive data-driven decision-making.

I regularly write about data engineering best practices, speak at tech meetups, and contribute to open-source projects in the data engineering ecosystem.

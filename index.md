## 💡 What I Do

I build end-to-end data platforms that transform raw data into actionable insights:

* **Data Ingestion** - Real-time streaming (Kafka) and batch processing from cloud storage (S3, Azure Data Lake)
* **Distributed Processing** - Large-scale data transformation using PySpark and Databricks
* **Data Warehousing** - Building curated datasets in Snowflake with optimized data models
* **Pipeline Orchestration** - Workflow automation and monitoring with Apache Airflow
* **Analytics Engineering** - dbt transformations, data quality frameworks, BI integration

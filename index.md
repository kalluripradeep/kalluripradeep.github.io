# Welcome! 👋

<div class="hero-role"><span id="typing-text">Data Engineer</span></div>

I'm **Pradeep Kalluri**, a Data Engineer specializing in building scalable cloud data platforms and production-grade data pipelines.

Currently at **NatWest Bank** in London, designing and delivering reliable data engineering solutions that power analytics and business intelligence across the organization.

## 💡 What I Do

I build end-to-end data platforms that transform raw data into actionable insights:

- **Data Ingestion** - Real-time streaming (Kafka) and batch processing from cloud storage (S3, Azure Data Lake)
- **Distributed Processing** - Large-scale data transformation using PySpark and Databricks
- **Data Warehousing** - Building curated datasets in Snowflake with optimized data models
- **Pipeline Orchestration** - Workflow automation and monitoring with Apache Airflow
- **Analytics Engineering** - dbt transformations, data quality frameworks, BI integration

## 🎯 Technical Stack

**Languages:** Python (PySpark, Pandas), SQL, Shell Scripting  
**Cloud Platforms:** AWS (S3, Glue, Lambda), Azure (Databricks, ADF, Data Lake), Microsoft Fabric  
**Data Engineering:** Apache Kafka, Apache Airflow, Snowflake, dbt, ETL/ELT pipelines  
**Databases:** Snowflake, Azure SQL, Redshift, PostgreSQL, MySQL  
**DevOps:** Docker, Terraform, CI/CD (GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps), Git  
**BI Tools:** Tableau, Power BI
